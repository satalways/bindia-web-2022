    'question_1' => 'What type of Indian food is served?',
    'answer_1' => 'The main part of our menu is North Indian cuisine from the Punjab region, though we serve a few South Indian dishes like our Madras curry.',
    'question_2' => 'What characterizes the North Indian (Punjab) cuisine?',
    'answer_2' => 'The Punjab cuisine is typically based on lamb or chicken dishes with bread as the side dish.',
    'question_3' => 'Why is it not possible to get beef or pork at Bindia?',
    'answer_3' => 'In Punjab, Muslims and Hindus have lived side by side for centuries - and mutual respect for religion and customs have been a key ingredient for this coexistence.',
    'answer_3_I' => 'Since Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef, these two ingredients have naturally disappeared from the general Punjab cuisine over time.',
    'answer_3_II' => 'Though Punjab was divided by with the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the local culture and customs have remained practically intact.',
    'answer_3_III' => 'In accordance with Bindia’s culinary heritage, we, therefore, do not serve pork or beef.',
    'question_4' => 'Is it Indian or Pakistani food that is made at Bindia?',
    'answer_4' => 'The food we cook is mainly from the region of Punjab. With the partition of India and
                            Pakistan in 1947, Punjab was divided in two, but the food culture remained the same on both
                            sides of the border. Therefore we believe that the food culture is not politically
                            determined but geographically. So, if we have to be absolutely correct then it is neither
                            Indian nor Pakistani food but Punjabi food we make.',
    'our_kitchen_team' => 'Our kitchen team',
    'question_5' => 'Where do the chefs come from?',
    'answer_5' => 'All our chefs come from either India, Pakistan or Nepal and are all trained in the North Indian cuisine.
Since, there didn’t exist any official education or degree related to the North Indian cuisine until a few years ago, not all chefs have a formal degree.',
    'answer_5_I' => 'More importantly, they all have tons of experience from having cooked in an Indian kitchen for years, often decades. At Bindia, the only necessary qualifications are skills, experience, and, not least, adaptability to the Bindia way.',
    'question_6' => 'Is the chef an educated chef?',
    'answer_6' => 'Not all chefs have a formal degree as a chef. The reason why, is that until recently such an
                            education did not exist for the North Indian cuisine. This means that some of our older
                            chefs have never had that opportunity. Instead, they have tons of experience from having
                            cooked in an Indian kitchen for many years (often for decades).',
    'our_food' => 'Our food',
    'question_7_i' => 'Do Bindia use ghee?',
    'answer_7_i' => 'In accordance with true Indian traditions, Bindia use ghee in all dishes.',
    'question_7' => 'What is ghee?',
    'answer_7' => 'Ghee is 100% clarified buffalo/cow butter, and is a central element in the Indian kitchen, which gives the curry just the right taste.',
    'question_8' => 'Is there a lot of butter in the Butter Chicken?',
    'answer_8' => 'The word "butter" has nothing to do with the amount of butter in a Butter Chicken. Instead, "butter" alludes to the traditional precept that the meat should be so tender that it feels like cutting in butter.',
    'question_9' => 'Can I avoid garlic?',
    'answer_9' => 'Garlic is a key ingredient when creating the base of the curry.
However, if you have a garlic allergy, you can still safely order our Butter and Korma dishes.
If you dislike the notorious ‘garlic breath’, fear not! In the Indian kitchen, we fry the garlic and mix it with other spices, so it doesn’t give you the characteristic smell of raw garlic afterwards.
',
    'question_10' => 'Which dishes contain coriander?',
    'answer_10' => 'We sprinkle several dishes with fresh coriander when adding the final touch, just like our salad also contains a coriander-based dressing.',
    'answer_10_I' => 'If you are allergic to, or dislike, coriander, please remember to let our chefs know when you order.',
    'question_11' => 'What is the Oriental Nut Mix?',
    'answer_11' => 'Our Oriental Nut Mix consists of selected nuts, seeds, and spices, which we use in our Korma and Butter curries to give them a distinguished, creamy texture and almost sweet flavor.
This approach is a traditional, culinary practice from the mountainous regions of Northern India like the Punjab Himalayas.
',
    'answer_11_I' => 'Instead of using animal fats, the nuts provide the curries with the essential calories when living in these colder regions. These curries have a rich, yet subtle, nutty flavor to them and are less spicy than the ones you’ll find in Southern India.',
    'answer_11_II' => 'Just like every tradition and region have their own approach to the nut mix, we have carefully crafted our own unique mix at Bindia.',
    'question_12' => 'What is Bindia’s kebab?',
    'answer_12' => 'The word “kebab” literally means grilled meat. The kebab Bindia serve is the Indian type, which is not the same as the kebab in a typical shawarma place. When we prepare our kebabs, we mince the meat ourselves, knead in the vegetables and spices, before molding and grilling it.',
    'question_13' => 'Is the food Halal?',
    'answer_13' => 'In India, Muslims and Hindus have coexisted for centuries largely sharing the same regional, culinary customs. Therefore, there is a tradition of always eating halal meat. To reflect this tradition, we have chosen only to use halal meat.',
    'question_14' => 'What dishes are child friendly?',
    'answer_14' => 'The two curries, Butter and Korma are quite mild, and, therefore, suitable for children.',
    'question_15' => 'What is the difference between Nan and Paratha?',
    'answer_15' => 'While the well-known Nan bread is baked with wheat, flour, and yeast, the Paratha is made with wholemeal flour and without yeast.',
    'question_16' => 'Is the rice flavoured?',
    'answer_16' => 'Short answer: yes.',
    'answer_16_I' => 'By adding water to a roast of selected spices, we produce a broth, which we then boil the rice in. This gives the rice a rich, Indian flavor.',
    'question_17' => 'Why does rice not come for free with the meals?',
    'answer_17' => 'India is a huge country with many regions, each with their own culinary traditions. It is therefore customary to choose between many different types of side dishes such as rice, nan, paratha, raita, chutney, or salad. Merely adding rice to all our curries, would remove the opportunity to explore other traditionally types of side dishes that are served in India.',
    'question_18' => 'What are the different chutneys made of?',
    'answer_18' => 'Typically, chutney is fruit mashed with spices and naturally preserved with for example vinegar, sugar, or salt.',
    'answer_18_I' => 'In India you’ll find an endless number of chutneys. Similarly, at Bindia we change our chutney selection now and then, giving you the opportunity to try some of the different kinds available. However, the best ones, like the Mango or Mixed Pickles Chutney, can always be found in our selection.',
    'question_19' => 'What is in the salad dressing?',
    'answer_19' => 'Our salad dressing consists of various nuts, oils, vegetables, and coriander.',
    'question_20' => 'What is in the Mango Lassi?',
    'answer_20' => 'Our Mango Lassi consists of Indian mangoes, whole milk yoghurt, and water. We do not add any color or sugar.',
    'our_cooking' => 'Our cooking',
    'question_21' => 'Why is the rice heated in the microwave?',
    'answer_21' => 'When rice is cooked for take away, there are only two possibilities: microwave or rice
                            cooker. A rice cooker makes the rice lumpy and dry. This is suitable for jasmine rice, which
                            is typically used in Chinese and Thai food. Indian basmati rice should be loose and soft and
                            this is best done by heating it in a microwave.',
    'question_22' => 'Is it just ready-made food that is heated up in the take away shops?',
    'answer_22' => 'A good Indian curry takes a long time to cook and requires many hours of simmering and settling.
Consequently, the first, slow and patient part of making our traditional curries is done in our central kitchen in Hvidovre, leaving the final part of the cooking to be done in our away shops when your order is placed.',
    'packing_and_serving' => 'Packaging and serving',
    'question_23' => 'Is it possible to heat up the food the day after?',

    'question_24' => 'Can the take away boxes and lids withstand the heat in a conventional oven and/or microwave oven?',
    'answer_24' => 'The boxes and lids can NOT tolerate the heat in a conventional oven. They are also not suited for extended heating in a microwave, but they do, however, tolerate light heating in a microwave.',
