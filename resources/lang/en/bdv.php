        <h1>The very first one!</h1><br>
        <p>In the busiest part of Østerbro on Blegdamsvej right next to Trianglen and the main entrance to Fælledparken, lies the very first Bindia. Our Østerbro restaurant opened in September 2003 and for the following three years this was the only place in Copenhagen where you could enjoy classic Indian dishes made the Bindia way. Our place on Østerbro quickly became popular and our guests increasingly began to ask to get our food as take-away; as a matter of fact, the success of our Østerbro Bindia made us realize the popularity of Bindia’s Indian take-away.</p>
        <p>The next four Bindias we openened, therefore, had an increasing focus on our sought after take-away, while our Østerbro Bindia continued to function as restaurant and flagship for our popular North Indian kitchen.</p>
        <p>In 2010, our Bindia in Østerbro was completely renovated in an ambitious project and cooperation with the international architectural firm, Sweco.
        <br>Take a look inside Bindia in Østerbro <a href=":inside_view_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>During the following period from 2012 to 2015, this very first Bindia in Østerbro simultaneously became the focal point for our popular and always fully booked cooking classes taught by Bindia’s head chef and founder, Amer Suleman, who every weekend met and interacted with an excited and engaged crowd.</p>

        <h3>Take-away & Dine-in</h3>
        <p>Following a thorough streamlining of our entire chain of shops in 2020, our Østerbro Bindia is today a take-away and dine-in shop. This means that you can - as always – enjoy our popular Butter Chicken, Dal, or one of our many vegetarian and vegan dishes in our big, bright room, but that ordering, payment, and order pickup is handled by the counter.

        <p>Whether you’re by yourself or with a party, you’re always welcome in Bindia in Østerbro. We are still a favored place to visit for crowds of people going to (or from) international matches or large concerts at the national stadium of Denmark, Parken, which is only a stone’s throw away.</p>
        <p>During the summer, our guests prefer to use our cozy terrace, which can host about 40 people. This terrace is a lovely and calm place to enjoy our Indian food, as it is facing the small passageway going between Blegdamsvej and Ryesgade. The calmness found on our terrace is in sharp contrast to the traffic, which marks the area around Trianglen only few meters away.</p>

        <h3>Trianglen</h3>
        <p>Bindia in Østerbro are neighbors to the junction where Blegdamsvej, Nordre Frihavnsgade, Øster Alle, and Østerbrogade intersect, otherwise known as Trianglen.</p>
        <p>Since the 19th century, Trianglen has been the focal point of various means of transportation. First, it functioned as a stopping place for the horse driven carriages going to and from Dyrehaven, a park north of Copenhagen where these wagons (known as kapervogne) are still in use.</p>
        <p>Later the square became a central for the Copenhagen tram lines, which today is evident by the building Bien (“the Bee”) right in the middle of Trianglen. Designed by P.V. Jensen-Klint, this iconic building was established as waiting hall for the tramlines in 1907. Later Kiosk Bien moved in, and the building eventually received its unofficial name.</p>

        <h3>Take-away in Østerbro</h3>
        <p>Thankfully, there are plenty of more quiet places than Trianglen close to Bindia, where you can relax and enjoy our Indian take-away.</p>
        <p>The most obvious place is perhaps Fælledparken whose main entrance is right across Blegdamsvej. This is the largest and most visited park in Copenhagen, which all year hosts various guests and annual activities like May 1st, the carnival, or the DHL Run.</p>
        <p>If you prefer city life over park life, bring your Indian take-away for a stroll down the charming Nordre Frihavnsgade. After only a few hundred meters, you’ll find the Sqaure of Victor Borge – a nice opportunity to enjoy Bindia’s delicious take-away while watching the life of the street that in 2009 was chosen as the best street in Copenhagen by the local city guide, AOK.</p>
        <p>If you want more peace and quiet to enjoy our take-away, Sortedams Sø – the most northern of the Copenhagen Lakes – gets the final mention here and is only one block away from our Bindia in Østerbro.</p>
        <p>No matter where you want to bring your take-away, Bindia in Østerbro is easily accessible with both Trianglen and the Metro right next door.</p>

        <h3>Nothing wasted</h3>
        <p>No matter if you want to enjoy our take-away in nature or stay as our dinner guest, you are welcome every day from 16.00 – 21.00 on Blegdamsvej 130!</p>
        <p>We will serve you large, healthy portions that are furthermore well-suited for refrigeration and reheating. Read more about our recommendations for reheating our take-away <a target="_blank" href=":reheat_link">here</a>.</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact, the good, old-fashioned Indian cooking methods, which we proudly preserve and continue, provide the food a natural and sustainable durability and are a key factor to how we can all help minimize food waste.</p>
        <p>A true Indian curry takes a long time to make as it requires many hours to simmer and settle. The very final part of the cooking is not done until your order is placed – and we never use more than you “take away”.</p>
        <p>Bindia actually wastes so little food that, in spite of an already signed collaboration contract, the initiative against food waste, <a href="https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us" target="_blank">Too Good To Go</a> found it completely pointless to include us on their app.</p>

        <h3>Greener take-away</h3>
        <p>Since 2015, Bindia have been certified with the official Organic Cuisine Label as we were the first Indian kitchen in Scandinavia to focus on ecology and sustainability. Furthermore, we never use preservatives, additives, or food colouring, and never deep fry anything.</p>
        <p>At Bindia, we have a crystal-clear ambition of continuing to become even greener and in 2020 we therefore decided to make our take-away packaging more eco-friendly. Everything from our take-away bags to our menu cards and take-away bowls are now made from 100% recycled, non-bleached paper. Both the paper bags and menu cards can be recycled as paper. However, we recommend re-using the paper bag as much as possible first.</p>
        <p>This way you can enjoy the best Indian take-away with a clean conscience!</p>
